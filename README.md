CONTEXT
Reverberation is a sonic effect that has a profound impact in music. Its implications extend to many levels such as musical composition, musical performance, sound perception and, in fact, it nurtured the sonority of certain musical styles (e.g. plainchant). Such relationship was possible because the reverberation of concert halls is stable (i.e. does not drastically vary). However, what implications surface to music composition and music perfor-mance when reverberation is variable? How to compose and perform music for situations in which reverberation is constantly changing?
