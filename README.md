<b>WALLACE </b><br/>

<b> Equipment requirements </b> <br/>(a) Laptop with MaxMSP 7 software (or later version) installed - a freeware you can download at http://www.cycling74.com/downloads/.<br/>(b) Microphone for the flute, mixer (6 sends), soundcard with 8 outputs and a PA with 8 high quality loudspeakers. <br/>(c) This software requires the external library - Hiss Tools - that can be downloaded at https://github.com/HISSTools/HISSTools_Impulse_Response_Toolbox. <br/>
(d) This software requires the fiddle~ object. <br/>(e)Although this piece is best experienced using 8 loudspeakers, a setup of 4 (or even 2) is possible.


<b> General remarks</b> <br/>(a) Both the performer and the audience should be at the same height.<br/>(b) The loudspeakers should surround the audience and the performer must be at the periphery of the "circle".<br/>(c) The ideal sound amplication should be clear and dry (i.e. close miking). The acoustic sound of the  ute should be a the same level as the electronics. The amount of amplication, even in the case where an additional support is needed and supplied by the mixing desk, should aim at merging the electronics and the acoustic sound.<br/>(d) The performer triggers the "presets" using the keyboard of the laptop, preferably placed on the right side. The keys to be pressed are speci ed in the score and should be pressed at the exact place as written in it.<br/>(e) The performer needs to choose in the MaxMSP patch if a setup of 8, 4 or 2 loudspeakers is used.<br/>

A tutorial video will be online very soon!<br/>
